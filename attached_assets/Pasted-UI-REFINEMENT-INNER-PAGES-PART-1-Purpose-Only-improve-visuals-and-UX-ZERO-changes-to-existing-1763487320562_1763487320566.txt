UI REFINEMENT – INNER PAGES (PART 1)
Purpose: Only improve visuals and UX – ZERO changes to existing logic.

=========================================================
PAGE 1 — SCAN QR PAGE (opened from big Scan card or bottom Scan button)
=========================================================
Layout:
• Full-screen premium scan interface (camera preview centered)
• Subtle frosted blur overlay around edges (premium feel)
• Header text centered: “Scan QR”
• Description under header: “Select your action.”

Two large pill-style radio buttons ABOVE the scanner camera:
1) “Install New Asset”
2) “Clock In / Clock Out”

• User selects one BEFORE scanning.
• When one is selected, button highlights (soft glow + checkmark).

After scanning:
• If “Install New Asset” was chosen → go to existing asset entry workflow (nothing changes except visuals).
• If “Clock In / Clock Out” was chosen → go to existing check-in/out workflow (nothing changes except visuals).

Button hierarchy:
• Keep “Cancel / Back to Dashboard” at bottom of screen (small, non-dominant).
• All functional logic MUST remain exactly as it is now.

Main goal:
Make the Scan page look expensive and instantly understandable without changing functionality.

=========================================================
PAGE 2 — ASSETS INSTALLED PAGE
=========================================================
Layout:
• Page title: “All Installed Assets”
• Sub-title: “Search everything you’ve tagged.”

Search + filters:
• Search bar at top (sticky, no scrolling needed)
• Three radio buttons directly under search:
  ▪ All Assets
  ▪ Installed by Me
  ▪ Installed by Team

Below the filters:
• Asset list loads as premium radio cards
Each card displays:
  • Asset type (Water Heater, HVAC, Panel, etc.)
  • Install date
  • Address
  • Installer name (only if team)
  • Status: “Active / Warranty Expiring / Maintenance Due”

Card tap opens the full existing Asset Details page.
No change to fields, AI triggers, or logic.

Asset Details page (visual polish only):
• Keep all current data, but format cleanly in a vertical stack
• Each row = label bold left, value right (Apple/Stripe style)
• At bottom keep:
  ▪ Call Owner button
  ▪ Email Owner button
  ▪ “Download PDF” button

Nothing on the Assets page or Asset Details page should change how data is saved or retrieved — purely UX/UI improvements.

=========================================================
PERFORMANCE NOTE
=========================================================
• Pages must load instantly
• No full-screen page transitions that slow performance
• All animations <200ms for premium responsiveness

=========================================================
DO NOT CHANGE
=========================================================
• All backend logic
• All AI predictive reminder logic
• All bottom navigation
• All asset saving flows
• All worker tracking flows
This is ONLY visual polish and UX organization.

=========================================================
After Scan + Assets pages are complete, tell me “PART 2”
and I will deliver the Reminders + Team & Assignments UI spec.
