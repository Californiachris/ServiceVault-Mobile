PART 3 — SECONDARY PAGES (keep ALL current functionality, only visual + UX polish)

IMPORTANT:
• DO NOT alter any working backend logic
• DO NOT change header or bottom nav
• Only polish the UI and layout so every page looks Fortune-500 SaaS level
• Every page must feel like the same premium design system
