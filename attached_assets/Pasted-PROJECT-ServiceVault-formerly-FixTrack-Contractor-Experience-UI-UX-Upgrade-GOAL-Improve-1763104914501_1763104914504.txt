PROJECT: ServiceVault (formerly FixTrack) – Contractor Experience & UI/UX Upgrade

GOAL
----
Improve the contractor-facing experience so it looks and feels like a premium SaaS product
and increases subscription conversion – WITHOUT changing the core backend logic, DB schema,
or existing flows more than necessary.

Keep all existing routes & API logic in place. This is a FRONTEND + FLOW REWORK, not a rebuild.

KEY OBJECTIVE
-------------
Contractors must see CLEAR VALUE before they see PRICE.

We want:
- Higher trust on first login
- Cleaner, more "pro" visual design
- A simple, obvious flow: "See benefits → pick plan → generate sticker pack"

TECH ASSUMPTION
---------------
Keep the existing stack (React / Vue / plain HTML/CSS – whatever is already used).
Just modify components, styling, and copy in that stack.

-------------------------------------
1. FIRST LOGIN / CONTRACTOR DASHBOARD
-------------------------------------

CURRENT PROBLEM (from video):
- First screens feel plain and "MVP"
- Not enough explanation of what the app does BEFORE subscription
- Too much empty white and generic labels

DESIRED BEHAVIOR:
When a contractor logs in and has 0 active packs / no subscription, show a
"Welcome / Overview" dashboard instead of a bare dashboard.

LAYOUT (mobile-first, responsive):

[ Top Bar ]
- Left: ServiceVault logo (or text logo for now)
- Right: Contractor name or "Account" icon

[ Hero Section ]
- Big headline:
  "Turn every install into a lifetime customer."

- Subheadline (2 lines max):
  "Place a ServiceVault QR on each job. One scan shows the customer AND you the full asset history and routes them back to your company."

- 3 bullet benefits with icons:
  - "Your logo + contact on every installed asset"
  - "Automatic warranty & service reminders"
  - "Proof of work and asset history in one scan"

[ Primary CTA ]
- Big button (full width on mobile):
  "Generate Your Sticker Pack"

- Secondary text link:
  "See how it works (30-second overview)" → For now this can just scroll down to an "How It Works" section.

[ How It Works – 3 Steps ]
Visually show 3 numbered steps (icons or simple illustrations):

1) "We ship you contractor-branded QR stickers"
2) "You stick one on each installed asset"
3) "Customers scan → see details → call you directly"

Below that, small CTA:
  Button: "Choose Your Plan & Get Stickers"

-------------------------------
2. PLAN SELECTION / PRICING UI
-------------------------------

CURRENT PROBLEM (from video):
- Pricing appears in a very plain format
- No strong value framing around each tier
- Looks like a generic app billing page, not a high-value trade tool

DESIRED PRICING (current business decision):
- $49.99/mo – 50 branded stickers
- $69.99/mo – 100 branded stickers
- $120/mo – 250 branded stickers

DESIRED PLAN LAYOUT:
Three responsive "plan cards" side by side (stacked on mobile):

Plan Card Layout (for each):

- Plan name (top):
  e.g. "Starter", "Pro", "Elite"

- Price (big text):
  e.g. "$49.99 / month"

- Subtext:
  e.g. "50 contractor-branded stickers / month"

- Divider

- Bullet list (3–5 bullets):

  Starter (50)
  - "50 QR stickers with your logo each month"
  - "Each sticker links to a full asset record"
  - "Customers scan and call your company directly"
  - "Basic service reminders & asset history"

  Pro (100) [mark this as "Most Popular"]
  - "100 QR stickers with your logo each month"
  - "Perfect for growing service businesses"
  - "Advanced reminders and asset tracking"
  - "Best balance of volume and price"

  Elite (250)
  - "250 QR stickers with your logo each month"
  - "For busy teams and multi-tech companies"
  - "Maximize your repeat customers"
  - "Best value per sticker"

- CTA Button at bottom of each card:
  - "Choose Starter"
  - "Choose Pro"
  - "Choose Elite"

VISUAL NOTE:
- Highlight Pro plan with:
  - Slightly bigger card
  - "Most Popular" tag at the top
- Use cards with shadows & rounded corners so it feels like modern SaaS
- Avoid plain unstyled lists or tables

------------------------------------
3. FLOW: VALUE BEFORE PAYMENT
------------------------------------

REQUIRED FLOW (IMPORTANT):

1) Contractor logs in →
2) Sees the "Welcome / Overview" dashboard (hero + benefits + "Generate Pack")
3) Clicks "Generate Your Sticker Pack" OR "Choose Plan & Get Stickers" →
4) Goes to PRICING page (plan cards described above) →
5) Selects a plan (Starter / Pro / Elite) →
6) THEN go to the payment/subscription step (Stripe, etc.)

Right now, the app should NOT show a payment wall as the first meaningful experience.
It must show benefits and purpose first.

Make sure:
- If contractor has no active plan:
  - They are ALWAYS funneled through:
    Overview → Plan selection → Payment → Confirmation → "Your first pack is ready."
- If contractor DOES have an active plan:
  - Take them directly to their real dashboard (assets, packs, stats).

-----------------------------
4. CONTRACTOR DASHBOARD UI
-----------------------------

ONCE A CONTRACTOR HAS A PLAN:
The default dashboard should show:

[ Section 1 – Quick Stats ]
- "# of active QR stickers issued"
- "# of assets claimed"
- "# of scans this month" (if trackable)
- Next renewal date

[ Section 2 – Sticker Packs ]
- List of packs with:
  - Pack name (e.g. "November 2025 – 100 pack")
  - Created date
  - "Used: 37 / 100" indicator
  - Button: "View codes / export CSV"

[ Section 3 – Assets ]
- Table/list with:
  - Asset name
  - Type (water heater, AC, etc.)
  - Location (short)
  - Last service date
  - View button

The main CTA on this dashboard should ALWAYS be:
  "Generate New Sticker Pack" (if allowed by plan) or
  "View Your QR Codes"

--------------------------------
5. VISUAL & UX POLISH GUIDELINES
--------------------------------

These changes are PURELY visual and layout – do NOT change business logic:

- Use card-based layout (cards with shadow and border radius) instead of flat text sections.
- Reduce plain white full-screen backgrounds. Introduce:
  - Very light grey background for app body
  - White cards on top for content
- Use consistent font sizing for headings:
  - Page title: 22–26px
  - Section titles: 18–20px, bold
  - Body text: 14–16px
- Buttons:
  - Use one primary color for CTAs (e.g. blue or green that matches branding)
  - Full-width on mobile
  - Clear wording: "Generate Sticker Pack", "Choose Pro Plan", etc. (no vague "Submit" or "Next")

- Spacing:
  - Ensure consistent padding around sections (at least 16–24px)
  - Avoid cramming everything into one screen; use breathing room

- Feedback / errors:
  - On any blocking step (plan selection, payment), show clear error messages with simple language:
    e.g., "Payment failed. Please check your card details or try again."

--------------------------------
6. DO NOTS
--------------------------------

- Do NOT change backend IDs, DB table names, or route shapes unless absolutely necessary.
- Do NOT rename core entities ("contractors", "assets", "packs") without alignment.
- Do NOT add new required form fields that could slow down onboarding.
- Do NOT move pricing BEFORE benefit explanation again.

--------------------------------
7. DELIVERABLES
--------------------------------

- Updated frontend screens for:
  - First-login overview / welcome dashboard (no packs yet)
  - Pricing / plan selection page with 3 cards and clear CTAs
  - Post-subscription contractor dashboard (with packs + assets sections)

- Ensure:
  - Mobile responsive
  - Clean, professional look
  - Clear value messaging for contractors
  - Frontend integrated with existing backend logic (no flow breaks)
