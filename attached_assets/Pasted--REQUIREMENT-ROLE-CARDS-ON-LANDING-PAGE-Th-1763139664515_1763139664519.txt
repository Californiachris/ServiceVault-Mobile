============================
REQUIREMENT: ROLE CARDS ON LANDING PAGE
============================
These are NOT placeholders. They must be premium SaaS-style cards that drive users into their correct subscription funnel.

VISUAL REQUIREMENTS
-------------------
• 4 cards arranged in a 2x2 grid on desktop, stacked vertically on mobile
• Each card must use a clean, modern SaaS UI:
  – White card on light grey background
  – Rounded corners
  – Shadow/elevation effect (subtle)
  – Generous spacing (no crammed layouts)
  – Each card must look clickable
• All icons MUST share the same visual style (no clipart)
• Font sizes must be readable on mobile (not tiny)

CARD STRUCTURE (EVERY CARD MUST FOLLOW THIS EXACT FORMAT)
----------------------------------------------------------
[ ICON ] (high-quality, consistent style)
[ TITLE ] (“For Contractors”, “For Homeowners”, etc.)
[ DESCRIPTION — 1 to 2 sentences MAX, written below ]
[ CTA BUTTON — full width on mobile ]

BUTTON LABEL (for all four cards)
----------------------------------
“Learn more”

ON CLICK BEHAVIOR (CRITICAL)
----------------------------
Clicking the card OR the “Learn more” button must open that role’s PUBLIC welcome page:

• CONTRACTOR CARD → /contractor
• HOMEOWNER CARD → /homeowner
• FLEET CARD → /fleet
• PROPERTY MANAGER CARD → /property-manager

NO LOGIN REQUIRED to open these pages.

COPY TO INSERT INSIDE EACH CARD
-------------------------------

CARD #1 — CONTRACTORS
Icon: Toolbox / wrench / hard hat
Title: For Contractors
Description (MUST copy exactly as written):
Turn every install into repeat business. Your logo on every asset + automatic service reminders that bring customers back to YOU every time.

CARD #2 — HOMEOWNERS
Icon: House
Title: For Homeowners
Description (MUST copy exactly as written):
Know everything about every system in your home — model numbers, installations, warranties and who to call when something needs service.

CARD #3 — FLEET MANAGEMENT
Icon: Truck / vehicle
Title: For Fleet Management
Description (MUST copy exactly as written):
Every vehicle and unit logged automatically. Reduce breakdowns, track service history, and keep maintenance running on time.

CARD #4 — PROPERTY MANAGERS
Icon: Apartment building
Title: For Property Managers
Description (MUST copy exactly as written):
Every unit. Every asset. Every service call. Full history and contractor details in one place — even when tenants change.

DO NOTS (IMPORTANT)
-------------------
• DO NOT make tiny or plain cards with only a title
• DO NOT use placeholder text (lorem ipsum, etc.)
• DO NOT nest the button inside a dropdown
• DO NOT route anywhere except the 4 welcome pages
• DO NOT require login at this stage

SUCCESS CRITERIA
----------------
The role cards should instantly communicate:
1) Who the product is for
2) The main benefit to that user
3) A clickable path to continue
