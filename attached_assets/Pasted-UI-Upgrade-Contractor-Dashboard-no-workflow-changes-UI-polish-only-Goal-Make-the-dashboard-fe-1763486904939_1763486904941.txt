UI Upgrade – Contractor Dashboard (no workflow changes, UI polish only)

Goal:
Make the dashboard feel ultra-premium (Fortune-500 SaaS look) while keeping the existing layout, navigation, and logic 100% intact.

What stays exactly the same:
• Header layout (ServiceVault logo left + name)
• Bottom navigation (Dashboard / Scan QR / Assets / Reminders)
• Actions and workflow remain identical
This is ONLY a visual refinement.

🔹 Change #1 — Make “Scan QR” dominant
• Increase the size of the Scan QR card so it is the most visually important element on the dashboard.
• Recommended: ~30–40% taller than the other cards.
• Purpose: It should be unmissable as the primary action contractors use throughout the day.

🔹 Change #2 — Visual polish for all dashboard cards
Apply these styling upgrades to ALL dashboard cards (including Scan QR, Assets Installed, Reminders, Team & Assignments):
• Softer frosted-glass / blur background feel (premium / Apple-style)
• Slight depth shadow to feel tactile
• Subtle hover/press animation (scale 102% or brightness) for premium touch feedback
• Rounded corners stay the same
• Icons should glow slightly on card focus/press

🔹 Change #3 — Updated micro-text descriptions
Replace the small sub-text under each card with cleaner, high-clarity copy:

Scan QR:
“Install assets or clock in with one tap.”

Assets Installed:
“Search and export every asset you’ve ever tagged.”

Reminders:
“Maintenance, warranty and follow-up jobs in one place.”

Team & Assignments:
“Add workers, review hours and assign tomorrow’s jobs.”

🔹 Change #4 — Reminder system clarity
Make sure the Reminders card ONLY shows reminders generated from:
• Real installed assets
• AI predictive maintenance dates
• Warranty expirations
(No generic reminders — only based on actual asset data.)

🔹 Change #5 — Keep performance fast
Cards must load instantly and not trigger scrolling on most phones.
The dashboard should open fast, read fast, and act fast — zero friction.

Summary:
• Scan QR = biggest card
• Other cards uniform + premium UI polish
• All function stays the same
• No changes to header or bottom nav
• Goal: ultra-premium, modern, billion-dollar-SaaS feel

After this UI pass is done, I will provide the next set of refinements for inner pages.
