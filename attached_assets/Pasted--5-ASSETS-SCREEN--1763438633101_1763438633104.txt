- Next time worker clocks in for that day:
    • After successful clock-in, show a screen:
        “Good morning, [Name]. Here are today’s assignments:”
        • List tasks with checkboxes.
        • Worker can tap to mark each task complete.
- Contractor can see completion in worker profile → Scheduled Assignments.

==================================================
8. WORKER EXPERIENCE (HIGH LEVEL)
==================================================

When a worker logs in:
- Sees a simplified version of dashboard:
    • Big “Scan QR” card
    • “My hours” card
    • “My installs” card
- Same Scan screen as contractor BUT default mode = “Clock In / Out”.
- When clocking in and assignments exist:
    • Immediately show today’s task list.

Everything worker does (installs, time, tasks) is automatically visible to contractor in Team, Assets and Timesheets.

==================================================
9. PERFORMANCE & POLISH
==================================================

Please preserve / extend all scalability work already in place:

- Use existing paginated endpoints for:
    • Jobs/assets
    • Events
    • Properties
- Any new lists (Assets, Team, Reminders) should:
    • Default to 20 items per page
    • Use “Load more” (not infinite scroll)
- All DB queries should use existing indexes on:
    • contractorId, userId, propertyId, assetId, createdAt, status

Polish:
- Add smooth but subtle transitions between main screens (fade/slide, nothing heavy).
- Keep everything visually consistent with current ServiceVault dark theme and typography.
- No new visual style systems; reuse existing card/button components.

Billion-dollar test:
- A contractor lands on the dashboard and knows in 2 seconds:
    1) “Tap Scan to install or clock in.”
    2) “Tap Assets to find anything I’ve ever installed.”
    3) “Tap Reminders to see what needs attention.”
    4) “Tap Team to see who’s working and what they did.”
- Everything else (billing, logo, sticker orders) lives in the hamburger and stays out of their daily way.
