UI REFINEMENT – INNER PAGES (PART 2)
Purpose: ONLY improve visuals and UX — ZERO changes to backend or working flows.

=========================================================
PAGE 3 — REMINDERS PAGE
=========================================================
Layout:
• Page title: “Maintenance & Warranty Reminders”
• Sub-title: “All automated reminders generated from installed assets.”

Filters at top:
• 3 radio buttons (horizontal layout)
  ▪ All
  ▪ Maintenance Due
  ▪ Warranty Expiring

Below filters:
• List items styled as premium radio cards — each card shows:
  • Asset name / type
  • Address
  • Due type (Maintenance or Warranty)
  • Due date
  • “Priority” tag if overdue

Reminder card tap opens existing Asset Details page.
(No changes to fields or AI logic — visual upgrade only.)

From the reminder card footer:
• Buttons:
  ▪ “Contact Owner”
  ▪ “View Asset”
• **This does NOT change logic — it just gives faster access.**

=========================================================
PAGE 4 — TEAM & ASSIGNMENTS (for Contractor accounts only)
=========================================================
When user clicks “Team” button on dashboard:

Layout:
• Page title: “Team”
• Sub-title: “Manage workers & performance.”

Below title:
• Large card button: “Add New Worker” (opens existing worker-add flow unchanged)

Then list of workers (radio cards)
Each worker card shows:
  • Worker name
  • Role (Installer / Tech / Helper etc.)
  • Hours worked this week
  • Total jobs completed

Tapping a worker opens WORKER PROFILE page.

---------------------------------------------------------
WORKER PROFILE PAGE (visual polish only)
---------------------------------------------------------
Keep all existing logic — just organize visually:

• Top section: Worker name + role
• Three radio buttons:
  1) Hours & Timesheets
  2) Jobs Completed
  3) Assigned Tasks

-------------------------
1) Hours & Timesheets
-------------------------
• Show clock-in/out events chronologically
• Weekly total displayed at top
• “Download Timesheet PDF” button at bottom

-------------------------
2) Jobs Completed
-------------------------
• List each completed asset install as radio cards
• Tap opens the asset details page (existing page — no logic change)

-------------------------
3) Assigned Tasks
-------------------------
• List of all assigned tasks
• Each task shows:
  ▪ Status (Pending / In Progress / Completed)
  ▪ Timestamp
• **No changes to task or scanning logic — just UX polish**

---------------------------------------------------------
SCHEDULE ASSIGNMENTS (from Team page)
---------------------------------------------------------
Button label on Team page:
• “Schedule Assignments”

Schedule Assignments page layout:
• Page title: “Assign Work”
• Sub-title: “Send tomorrow’s task list instantly.”

Two button workflow:
1) Select Worker → opens worker picker (radio button list of all workers)
2) Select Tasks → opens existing task entry / checklist system (NO changes to backend)

When saved:
• Confirmation modal:
  ▪ “Tasks Assigned Successfully”
  ▪ Buttons: “Close” and “Assign Another Worker”

**Workers receive tasks upon next clock-in exactly as they do now.  
No workflow changes — visual clarity upgrade only.**

=========================================================
IMPORTANT — DO NOT CHANGE
=========================================================
• Keep bottom navigation exactly as it is now  
• Keep scan logic 100% untouched  
• Keep AI reminders 100% untouched  
• Keep login / logo pipeline 100% untouched  
• Keep worker dashboard logic 100% untouched  

The ONLY objective here is:
• Cleaner layout
• Faster usability
• Ultra-premium Fortune-500 UI polish

=========================================================
After Reminders + Team pages are done,
we will move to part 3: Worker dashboard UX (very small upgrade).
